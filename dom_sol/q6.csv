,Lets find X* with below add ons,,,,,,,,,,,
,"1. Assuming sales >=400, then Addional revenue=40000*.05=",,,,,2000,overall; So per unit on 400 (minimum qty)=,,,,5,$per unit
,So Cu=5+5-3=,,7,,,,,,,,,
,Co=3-0.5*3+.5=,,2,,,,,,,,,
,So F(X*)=,,0.777777778,,,,,,,,,
,X*=,,353.3333333,,at 0.5 refund fraction,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"1. Assuming X* >=380, then Addional revenue=40000*.03=",,,,,1200,overall; So per unit on 380 (minimum qty)=,,,,3.2,$per unit
,So Cu=5+3.2-3=,,5.2,,,,,,,,,
,Co=3-0.5*3+.5=,,2,,,,,,,,,
,So F(X*)=,,0.722222222,,,,,,,,,
,X*=,,336.6666667,,at 0.5 refund fraction,,,,,,,
