1,,Suppose selling price is $5. So Cost of Underage=5-3=$2; Cost of overage=3+0.5-3*0.5=2. So the right balance would be at the mid point and hence 270. ,,,,,,,,
,,"This is because for every unit extra we don’t sell, it would cost $2 and every unit shortage we have, we loos $2 as well. ",,,,,,,,
,,We need to find the spot where P(D>=Q)=P(D<=Q)=Mean demand for the uniform distribution and in this case it is 270,,,,,,,,
,,"At $6 selling price, the custo of Underage=6-3=$3 while the cost of overage remains the same at $2. So it hurts to loose sales than have overages. ",,,,,,,,
,,"So in this case, the tendence would be to keep higher stock than mid point and hence more than 270",,,,,,,,
