ISyE 6334 – Group Project (Fall 2025)
Due: December 9, 2025 Teams: Up to 3 students
Submission: Upload a single PDF containing an executive summary (2–3 pages) and
appendices (spreadsheets, screenshots, and code from Excel/Python/Matlab/R).

The SparkFire Venture
Background
You are analysts at SparkFire LLC, a Georgia-based distributor of fireworks. The
wholesaler Leisure Limited supplies temporary roadside stands for the July 4 season.
Participants purchase inventory, sell it during the week before the holiday, and return
unsold boxes for a partial refund.
Returned boxes lose quality, so only part of the wholesale cost is refunded. To encourage competition, Leisure Limited offers a Corvette Prize to the stand with the highest
statewide sales volume.
Your supervisor, Talia Rogers, has asked you to determine how many firecracker sets
to order and to analyze how pricing, refund policy, discounts, and contextual information
affect profit and risk.

Base Market and Cost Information
Item Symbol Base Value Notes
Wholesale cost c $3.00 before discount
Selling price p $5 or $6 decision variable
Refund fraction f 0.50 scenarios 0.25–0.75
Return shipping s $0.50 per unit
Administrative fee K $20 per order
Prize value V $40,000 Corvette reward
Discount tiers – see Part 7 wholesale reductions
Demand: Uniform(120, 420) sets; independent of price in the base case.

Interpreting Ambiguity
Real projects contain imperfect information. Some details are intentionally slightly ambiguous (e.g., prize thresholds, signal accuracy). Identify the ambiguity, state a reasonable
assumption, and justify it (1–3 sentences). There is no single “correct” interpretation—
grading emphasizes the quality and consistency of your reasoning.

Total 100

1 – Conceptual Analysis (5 pts)
Should the optimal order quantity exceed, equal, or fall below expected demand (midpoint
= 270)? Explain using overage vs. underage trade-offs without first calculating the
optimal Q.

2 – Optimal Order Quantity (7 pts)
Determine the optimal order quantity (Q∗
) that maximizes expected profit, assuming
p = $5 and f = 0.5. Show your newsvendor model, profit equation, and numeric result.
Reflection (≤ 100 words): Identify one significant limitation of the uniform-demand
assumption and how a different distribution (e.g., Normal or Lognormal) could bias Q∗
or expected profit.

3 – Refund Sensitivity (7 pts)
Re-compute Q∗
for refund rates f = 25% and f = 75%. Discuss how refund generosity
affects the optimal order quantity, expected profit, and SparkFire’s financial risk.

4 – Pricing Decision (8 pts)
Assume demand is not affected by price. Find the new optimal quantity Q∗
if the price
is set to p = $6 (with f = 0.5). Compare the expected profits of the (p = $5, Q∗
p=5) and
(p = $6, Q∗
p=6) policies and recommend a course of action.
Reflection (≤ 50 words): Briefly comment on how your p = $6 policy might change if
raising the price decreased demand (no calculation needed).

5 – Risk & Simulation (12 pts)
Using the optimal policy from Part 2 (p = $5, Q∗
), simulate ≥ 500 trials of demand and
profit. Report the mean profit, standard deviation of profit, and the probability of a loss
(profit < 0). Propose one risk-mitigation strategy based on your findings.
Local Reflection (≤ 75 words): How might Georgia’s weather (e.g., a very rainy June) or
local regulations (e.g., a last-minute fireworks ban in a major county) affect your results?

6 – Behavioral Incentive (13 pts)
Leisure Limited awards $40,000 to the stand with highest sales. SparkFire estimates a
5% chance of winning if actual sales are ≥ 400 units. Other states use 3% if actual sales
≥ 380 or 7% if actual sales ≥ 420 are mentioned as context.
(a) Modify your profit model to account for the possibility of awards.
(b) Find the new quantity Q∗∗ that maximizes total expected returns.
(c) Compare Q∗∗ to Q∗
(from Part 2) and discuss how this incentive scheme encourages
risk-seeking or risk-averse behavior.
Assumption & Reflection (≤ 150 words): State which prize rule you used (e.g., the 5%
@ 400) and why. Discuss the limitation of adding a small expected value to the model
versus the behavioral desire to win a $40,000 prize.

7 – Quantity Discounts (13 pts)
The wholesaler offers all-units discounts. The unit cost c changes based on the total Q
ordered:
Order Qty Unit Cost (c)
1–199 $3.00
200–399 $2.85
400+ $2.70
(a) Modify your profit model to account for the piecewise cost function.
(b) Find the new optimal quantity Q∗
d
(for p = $5, f = 0.5).
(c) Compare Q∗
d
and its expected profit to the Q∗ and profit from Part 2.
(d) Briefly explain how quantity discounts can help coordinate a supply chain.

8 – Context Signal & Deferred Purchasing (20 pts)
A market signal (S ∈ {High, Low}) becomes available after the initial order. P(High) =
0.45.
D|S = High ∼ U[240, 420], D|S = Low ∼ U[120, 260].
Two-stage process:
• Pre-season: Commit to an initial order (Q0) at the base cost c0 = $3.00.
• In-season: After seeing signal S, place a second, expedited top-up order (Q1(S)) at
a premium cost c1 = $3.60.
Refund (f = 0.5) and shipping (s = 0.5) terms are unchanged.
(a) Formulate the profit function π(Q0, Q1(·)).
(b) First, determine the optimal total inventory Q∗
S
for each signal S (Q∗
H and Q∗
L
) using
the second-stage costs. This defines the optimal policy Q∗
1
(S) = max(0, Q∗
S − Q0).
(c) Second, optimize the initial Q0. Find the Q∗
0
that maximizes the total expected profit
across both scenarios. Report the full policy (Q∗
0
, Q∗
1
(High), Q∗
1
(Low)) and the total
expected profit.
(d) Compute the Value of Signal and Reactive Capacity (VOSRC) using:
VOSRC = [Full Model Profit] − [Baseline Profit],
where Baseline Profit is your optimal expected profit from Part 2 and Full Model Profit
is your optimal expected profit from Part 8(c).
Justification (≤ 4 sentences): Based on your VOSRC, when is paying the expedited
premium rational given the quality of this signal?

9 – Open-Ended Discussion (Choose 2 out of 4, each worth 10
points out of 100)
Tie your answers to your analysis (Parts 2–8) and SparkFire’s context.
OE1. Contract Design. Propose a simple two-parameter contract (e.g., buyback + quantityflex or buyback + penalty) that aligns SparkFire and Leisure Limited incentives. Explain how it changes overage/underage trade-offs (Co, Cu) and what data you’d need
to set parameters.
OE2. Prize Mechanism Redesign. The Corvette prize can induce over-ordering. Redesign the incentive (e.g., prize based on profit, sell-through rate, or tiered thresholds)
to reduce waste while preserving motivation. Explain expected behavioral changes.
4
OE3. Two-Stand Allocation. Suppose SparkFire operates two nearby stands and can
rebalance limited inventory on July 3. Outline an allocation/hedging heuristic and
the conditions under which pooling materially improves profit.
OE4. Negotiation Playbook. If you could change one term—refund fraction f, shipping
s, or expedited cost c1—which gives the largest improvement per unit change? Support
with a brief sensitivity argument referencing your results (e.g., effects on VOSRC or
Q∗
).
